# DiscordSafari
This is a super simple WebKit wrapper around Discord to run it in Safari instead of Electron. It supports drag-n-drop file and open links. The entire code is in [ViewController.swift](DiscordSafari/ViewController.swift) (plus a few lines in  [AppDelegate.swift](DiscordSafari/AppDelegage.swift) to close when the window is closed)  and is under 100 lines long total.

The icon comes from [Elias' macosicons](https://github.com/elrumo/macOS_Big_Sur_icons_replacements)
