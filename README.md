# DiscordSafari
This is a super simple WebKit wrapper around Discord to run it in Safari instead of Electron. It supports drag-n-drop file and open links. The entire code is in [ViewController.swift](DiscordSafari/ViewController.swift) (plus a few lines in  [AppDelegate.swift](DiscordSafari/AppDelegage.swift) to close when the window is closed)  and is under 100 lines long total.

The icon comes from [Elias' macosicons](https://github.com/elrumo/macOS_Big_Sur_icons_replacements)

I believe this is allowed under Discord ToS - since I am not modifying the application in anyway, and am simply behaving as a web browser.

Use at your own risk, but it's an extremely simple app, so you can easily audit the code yourself. I recommend building the app for yourself; but a release is provided in releases.
